Utopia Config library is simple and lite library for managing application configuration. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/config
```

```php
# TODO: Document
```

## System Requirements

Utopia Framework requires PHP 8.0 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.

When using YAML adapter, or running tests with it, you need to install the YAML extension for PHP.
